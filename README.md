I am a software developer with over ten(10) years of experience, currently working at [Hellofresh](https://hellofresh.com/), Toronto Office.
I mainly code in `Python` and `Go` now, but in the past i also did a lot with `Java` `Php` `Javascript` and so many other modern web frameworks. I am always learning.
